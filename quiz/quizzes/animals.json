    "everything_correct": "Wow, you've clearly spent some quality time in the jungle! You got everything correct, just like a dolphin acing an echolocation test. Your knowledge of animal facts is so profound that even a parrot would find it hard to keep up with you. Keep up the excellent work, and remember to wear a helmet; a jealous woodpecker might be around the corner.",

    "very_good": "Fantastic! Your performance is as flashy as a peacock's tail. It seems like you've got a memory as strong as an elephant's. Sure, you missed a few, but nobody's perfect. Well, except for maybe the platypus, nature's most unlikely creature.",

    "good": "Not bad, not bad at all. You're as sharp as an eagle's eye. Sure, a few questions slipped past you like a ninja octopus, but overall, you have a fair amount of knowledge in that noggin of yours. Keep learning and maybe you'll be as wise as an owl one day.",

    "bad": "Well, it looks like you tripped up a bit there, kind of like a penguin on a banana peel. But don't let it get you down. Remember, a kangaroo doesn't start hopping right away, either. Keep learning and soon you'll be swinging through these quizzes like a chimpanzee in the jungle.",

    "very_bad": "Oh dear, your score is a bit like a fish out of water. But don't worry, even a tortoise finishes the race eventually. It seems the animal kingdom is a bit of a lion's den for you right now, but with a bit of practice, you'll be soaring like an eagle in no time.",

    "everything_wrong": "Well, looks like you've stumbled more than a newborn giraffe. Don't worry though, even a blind squirrel finds a nut sometimes. Brush up on your animal facts, and remember, every dog has its day. Next time, you might just make a comeback like a phoenix rising from the ashes."
