      "question": "Which statement is true about the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft?",
      "correct_answer": "They are released from vesicles within the neuron",
      "wrong_answers": [
        "They are synthesized in the synaptic cleft",
        "They are released by the postsynaptic neuron",

In fact, your neuron vesicles must be the life of the party at the cellular level. We wouldn't be surprised if your dendrites have a separate calendar just to schedule all those action potentials. Keep up the great work, synaptic superstar!",
    "very_good": "Impressive! You've obviously been hanging out in the synaptic cleft a bit. You know your neurotransmitters almost as well as a neuron knows its axon. With a bit more practice, your understanding could diffuse across the synaptic gap of knowledge just as swiftly as a serotonin molecule. Keep going, you're nailing this neurology thing!",
    "good": "Not bad at all! You've clearly been paying attention in the synaptic classroom. Sure, you might've mixed up your reuptake inhibitors with your ionotropic receptors a couple of times, but who hasn't? After all, it's easy to get disoriented in the bustling city of the synaptic cleft. Just keep studying and you'll be a neurotransmitter whizz in no time!",
    "bad": "Okay, so neurotransmitters might not be your strong suit. Maybe you confused dopamine with a donut or thought serotonin was a type of fabric. No worries - everyone has to start somewhere. Even neurons probably mixed up their axons and dendrites in the beginning. Just remember: practice makes perfect, and every mistake is a step closer to synaptic supremacy!",
    "very_bad": "Well, neurotransmitters can be tricky, can't they? Maybe you've been spending too much time with those silly neurotransmitter taxis or trying to interpret the dances of the synapse. But hey, even a misfired action potential can eventually find its way. Dust off those neuron textbooks and give it another shot. You've got this!",
    "everything_wrong": "Oh dear! It looks like your neurotransmitter knowledge might be stuck in the vesicles. Maybe you thought GABA was a type of cheese or that reuptake was a new dance move. But fear not, synaptic savant in training! Neurology is a marathon, not a sprint. So buckle up, dive back into the synaptic cleft, and keep going. The neuron wizards are cheering for you!"
