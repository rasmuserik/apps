You've got the knack for identifying scars from different cultures, and you probably have a secret collection of scar artifacts hidden somewhere in your basement. People often mistake you for a world-famous scar artist, and some have even offered you contracts to create scar patterns for them. Keep up the great work!",

You're the go-to person among your friends when it comes to identifying scars, and you've been known to organize scar-spotting parties where everyone shows off their unique scars.

Fear not, though. Your clumsy endeavors make for great party anecdotes!",
